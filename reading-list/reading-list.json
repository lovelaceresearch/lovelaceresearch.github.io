            "summary": "A groundbreaking exploration of the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman's work has profound implications for how we understand human-AI interaction."

            "author": "Marvin Minsky",
            "category": "Artificial Intelligence",
            "summary": "Minsky's classic work presents a theory of how intelligence can emerge from the interactions of many simple, non-intelligent agents. This book offers a compelling alternative to monolithic models of the mind and provides a rich source of inspiration for designing more modular and transparent AI systems."
